## Business Problem
Recruiting and retaining drivers is seen by industry watchers as a tough battle for Ola. Churn among drivers is high. You are working as a data scientist with the Analytics Department of Ola, focused on driver team attrition. You are tasked to predict whether a driver will be leaving the company or not based on:
- Demographics(city, age, gender)
- Tenure information (Joining Date, Last Date)
- Historical Data regarding the performance of the driver(Quarterly Rating, Monthly Business acquired, grade, income)

## Concepts Used:
Ensmeble Learning - Bagging
Ensemble Learning - Boosting
Hyperparamter Tuning - GridSearchCV, RandomizedSearchCV

## Aproach 
- Performed Univariate, Bivariate and Multivariate analysis.
- Performed Feature engineering, Class imbalance treatment and Standardization.
- Applied Bagging and Boosting and executed hyperparameter tuning using GridSearchCV and RandomizedSearchCV.

## Business Insights and Recommendations
- Based on Feature importance analysis, OLA may prioritize strategies and interventions aimed at improving total business value, retaining drivers who joined in earlier years, and managing quarterly ratings effectively.
- Ola should focus more on comming up with strategies that can increse the drivers quarterly ratings.
